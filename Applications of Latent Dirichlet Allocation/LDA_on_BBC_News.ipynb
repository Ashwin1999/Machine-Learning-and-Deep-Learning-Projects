            "Hodgson relish European clash Former Blackburn bos Roy Hodgson say the Premiership should follow the rest of Europe and have a winter break - but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the English elite 's bid for Champions League glory . Hodgson - now in charge at Viking Stavanger - wa at Liverpool 's clash with Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield on Tuesday a a member of Uefa 's technical committee . Hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout Europe , although not in England - where the Champions League contender have ploughed through a heavy fixture list . But Hodgson told BBC Sport that while he belief the Premiership should embrace the idea , he doe not expect it to cost the English representative in the last 16 of the Champions League . `` I just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that team who have had the break will have a definite edge . `` I am a fervent supporter of the break . It give player the chance to recharge their battery midway through the season , which some suggest will give team an advantage in the Champions League . `` The other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it put you at a disadvantage . `` The bigger discussion around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today , the need of football player and the way the Premiership ha developed , rather than one or two match in the Champions League in February . '' Hodgson belief a winter break carry many advantage , explaining : `` As I said , it is the perfect chance to recharge battery . `` And certainly if I wa still a manager in England I would be supporting any call for it introduction . `` In pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards Christmas many player , having also played plenty of international match for club and country and travelled a lot , find themselves getting very jaded . `` The break give them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and , perhaps more importantly , recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the game ahead . `` The mental side is by far the most important thing . '' Hodgson added : `` The length of break can vary . In Italy the break wa very short . You just took Christmas and New Year . `` It wa so short you did n't do anything . You gave the player a week or 10 day off , then you were training for a week or 10 day and then went into a game . `` If it is longer , it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the player a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stay with them . '' And Hodgson belief a winter break would be a positive step in the Premiership . He said : `` If we talk about football at elite level , which the Premiership is , then I would support a winter break . `` If you examine the demand of the Premier League and , in particular on player who play international football for their club and country , then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally .

'' The Foreign Office currently ha about 6,100 UK-based staff . It ha opened major new mission on Baghdad and Basra in Iraq , Kabul in Afghanistan and Pyongyang in North Korea since 1997 in response to what the government say are changing need .

The shake-up is aimed at helping making Â£86m in efficiency saving between 2005 and 2008 . The chancellor ha demanded all government department make similar saving . Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said there wa a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign mission . `` But the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic change it ha announced and must show that British commercial interest and the interest of Britons abroad will not be adversely affected , '' he said .\n",

            "Cardinal criticises Iraq war cost Billions of pound spent on conflict in Iraq and in the Middle East should have been used to reduce poverty , Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor ha said . The head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales made the comment on BBC Radio 4 and will re-iterate his stance in his Christmas Midnight Mass . The cardinal used a Christmas message to denounce the war in Iraq a a `` terrible '' waste of money . He and the Archbishop of Canterbury have both spoken out about the war . Speaking on BBC Radio 4 's Thought for the Day slot , he criticised the fact that `` billion '' have been spent on war , instead of being used to bring people `` out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease '' . The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to `` make history poverty '' . He added : `` If the government of the rich country were a ready to devote to peace the resource they are willing to commit to war , that would be to see with new eye and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to u with new ear . '' The cardinal will touch on this theme again on Friday night when he will tell the congregation of 2,000 at Westminster Cathedral that peace is `` worth , always , striving for '' . `` How is it that peace ha not arrived ? , '' the cardinal will ask . `` How is it that there is war in Iraq , violence in the Holy Land , and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace ? '' `` How can one wish a happy Christmas for our fellow Christians in Iraq or in the Holy Land or those who suffer in Africa unless you and I , in whatever way is open to u , say and do what make for peace ? '' Both the Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams appealed for the weapon inspector to be given more time in Iraq before the war started . Dr Williams ha since criticised the government over it case for war , saying the failure to find weapon of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system . On Friday , the Cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace . `` It is possible , it is real , it is worth , always , striving for , because of the promise of Our Saviour , '' he will say . `` I also wish you peace in your home because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the home of the community. `` A spokesman said Downing Street had no comment to make . But Prime Minister Tony Blair ha said he will put Africa at the top of the agenda when Britain chair the G8 summit next year .\n",
